        <p>The <b>Ford Mustang</b> is a series of American automobiles manufactured by Ford. In continuous production since 1964,
            the Mustang is currently the longest-produced Ford car nameplate. Currently in its sixth generation, it is the
            fifth-best selling Ford car nameplate. The namesake of the "pony car" automobile segment, the Mustang was 
            developed as a highly styled line of sporty coupes and convertibles derived from existing model lines, initially
            distinguished by "long hood, short deck" proportions.<sup>[3]</sup></p>

       <p>Originally predicted to sell 100,000 vehicles yearly, the 1965 Mustang became the most successful vehicle 
            launch since the 1927 Model A.<sup>[4]</sup> Introduced on April 17, 1964<sup>[5]</sup> (16 days after the Plymouth Barracuda),
            over 400,000 units in its first year; the one-millionth Mustang was sold within two years of its launch.
            <sup>[6]</sup> In August 2018, Ford produced the 10-millionth Mustang; matching the first 1965 Mustang, the vehicle
            was a 2019 Wimbledon White convertible with a V8 engine.<sup>[7]</sup></p>

        <p>The success of the Mustang launch led to multiple competitors from other American manufacturers, 
            including the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird<sup>[8]</sup> (1967), AMC Javelin (1968), and Dodge 
            Challenger<sup>[9]</sup> (1970). The Mustang also had an effect on designs of coupés worldwide, leading to the
            marketing of the Toyota Celica and Ford Capri in the United States (the latter, by Lincoln-Mercury).
            The Mercury Cougar was launched in 1967 as a unique-bodied higher-trim alternative to the Mustang;
            during the 1970s, it was repackaged as a personal luxury car.</p>

        <p>Executive stylist John Najjar, who was a fan of the World War II P-51 Mustang fighter plane, is 
            credited by Ford with suggesting the name.<sup>[10][11]</sup> Najjar co-designed the first prototype of the
            Ford Mustang known as the "Ford Mustang I" in 1961, working jointly with fellow Ford stylist Philip
            T. Clark.<sup>[12]</sup> The Mustang I made its formal debut at the United States Grand Prix in Watkins Glen,
            New York, on October 7, 1962, where test driver and contemporary Formula One race driver Dan Gurney
            lapped the track in a demonstration using the second "race" prototype. His lap times were only 
            slightly off the pace of the F1 race cars.<sup>[citation needed]</sup></p>

        <p>Lee Iacocca's assistant general manager and chief engineer, Donald N. Frey was the head engineer for the
            T-5 project—supervising the overall development of the car in a record 18 months<sup>[17]</sup>—while Iacocca himself
            championed the project as Ford Division general manager.<sup>[18]</sup> The T-5 prototype was a two-seat, mid-mounted
            engine roadster. This vehicle employed the German Ford Taunus V4 engine.</p>

        <p>The original 1962 Ford Mustang I two-seater concept car had evolved into the 1963 Mustang II four-seater concept car which
             Ford used to pretest how the public would take interest in the first production Mustang. The 1963 Mustang II concept car
              was designed with a variation of the production model's front and rear ends with a roof that was 2.7 in (69 mm) lower.<sup>[19]</sup>
               It was originally based on the platform of the second-generation North American Ford Falcon, a compact car.<sup>[20]</sup></p>

    <p>Iacocca, who had been one of the forces behind the original Mustang, became president of Ford Motor Company 
        in 1970, and ordered a smaller, more fuel-efficient Mustang for 1974. Initially, it was to be based on the 
        Ford Maverick, but ultimately was based on the Ford Pinto subcompact.</p>
        
    <p>The new model, called the "Mustang II", was introduced on September 21, 1973, two months before the first 1973
         oil crisis, and its reduced size allowed it to compete against successful imported sports coupés such as the
          Japanese Datsun 240Z, Toyota Celica and the European Ford Capri<sup>[40]</sup> (then Ford-built in Germany and Britain,
           sold in U.S. by Mercury as a captive import car). First-year sales were 385,993 cars, compared with the 
           original Mustang's twelve-month sales record of 418,812.<sup>[41]</sup> Ultimately, the Mustang II was an early example
            of downsizing that would take place among Detroit's Big Three during the "malaise era".<sup>[42]</sup></p>

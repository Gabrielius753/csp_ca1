    <h1>Ford Mustang - Wikipedia</h1>
        <p>The Ford Mustang is a series of American automobiles manufactured by Ford. In continuous production since 1964,
            the Mustang is currently the longest-produced Ford car nameplate. Currently in its sixth generation, it is the
            fifth-best selling Ford car nameplate. The namesake of the "pony car" automobile segment, the Mustang was 
            developed as a highly styled line of sporty coupes and convertibles derived from existing model lines, initially
            distinguished by "long hood, short deck" proportions.[3]</p>

       <p>Originally predicted to sell 100,000 vehicles yearly, the 1965 Mustang became the most successful vehicle 
            launch since the 1927 Model A.[4] Introduced on April 17, 1964[5] (16 days after the Plymouth Barracuda),
            over 400,000 units in its first year; the one-millionth Mustang was sold within two years of its launch.
            [6] In August 2018, Ford produced the 10-millionth Mustang; matching the first 1965 Mustang, the vehicle
            was a 2019 Wimbledon White convertible with a V8 engine.[7]</p>

        <p>The success of the Mustang launch led to multiple competitors from other American manufacturers, 
            including the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird[8] (1967), AMC Javelin (1968), and Dodge 
            Challenger[9] (1970). The Mustang also had an effect on designs of coupés worldwide, leading to the
            marketing of the Toyota Celica and Ford Capri in the United States (the latter, by Lincoln-Mercury).
            The Mercury Cougar was launched in 1967 as a unique-bodied higher-trim alternative to the Mustang;
            during the 1970s, it was repackaged as a personal luxury car.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Executive stylist John Najjar, who was a fan of the World War II P-51 Mustang fighter plane, is 
            credited by Ford with suggesting the name.[10][11] Najjar co-designed the first prototype of the
            Ford Mustang known as the "Ford Mustang I" in 1961, working jointly with fellow Ford stylist Philip
            T. Clark.[12] The Mustang I made its formal debut at the United States Grand Prix in Watkins Glen,
            New York, on October 7, 1962, where test driver and contemporary Formula One race driver Dan Gurney
            lapped the track in a demonstration using the second "race" prototype. His lap times were only 
            slightly off the pace of the F1 race cars.[citation needed]</p>


    <h2>First generation (1965-1973)</h2>
    <p>Lee Iacocca's assistant general manager and chief engineer, Donald N. Frey was the head engineer for the
         T-5 project—supervising the overall development of the car in a record 18 months[17]—while Iacocca himself
          championed the project as Ford Division general manager.[18] The T-5 prototype was a two-seat, mid-mounted
           engine roadster. This vehicle employed the German Ford Taunus V4 engine.</p>




    <h2>Second generation (1965-1973)</h2>
    <p>Iacocca, who had been one of the forces behind the original Mustang, became president of Ford Motor Company 
        in 1970, and ordered a smaller, more fuel-efficient Mustang for 1974. Initially, it was to be based on the 
        Ford Maverick, but ultimately was based on the Ford Pinto subcompact.</p>
